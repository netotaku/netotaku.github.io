The folks at [Bristol & Bath Marketing network](http://www.marketing-network.org/) have kindly asked me back to talk about the best way to form digital ideas. This time at the
[Clifton Club](http://www.thecliftonclub.co.uk/). The talk will be a slight revamped version of the [talk in Bath](/speaking/strategy/ideation/2015/01/29/De-Risking-Digital.html). Use the form below
to order ticket and I look forward to meeting everyone on the 14th.

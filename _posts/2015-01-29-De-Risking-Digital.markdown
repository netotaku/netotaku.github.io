<p>A big thank you to <a href="http://www.marketing-network.org/">Bath and Bristol Marketing Network</a>
( <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BBMN&src=tyah">#bbmn</a> ) for inviting me to
present my <a href="">De-Risking Digital</a> presentation at their first meeting of 2015.
It was standing room only and I was well received. I had a great time I hope everyone else
did to!.
